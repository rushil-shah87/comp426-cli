    <h1>History of the Minotaur</h1>
    <p>The origin story of the minotaur is as follows:</p>
    <p id="quote" class="highlight-on-hover">After ascending the throne of the island of Crete, Minos competed with his brothers as ruler. Minos
        prayed to the sea god Poseidon to send him a snow-white bull as a sign of the god's favour. Minos was to
        sacrifice the bull to honor Poseidon, but owing to the bull's beauty he decided instead to keep him. Minos
        believed that the god would accept a substitute sacrifice. To punish Minos, Poseidon made Minos' wife Pasiphaë
        fall in love with the bull. Pasiphaë had the craftsman Daedalus fashion a hollow wooden cow, which she climbed
        into in order to mate with the bull. The monstrous Minotaur was the result.

        Pasiphaë nursed the Minotaur but he grew in size and became ferocious. As the unnatural offspring of a woman and
        a beast, the Minotaur had no natural source of nourishment and thus devoured humans for sustenance. Minos,
        following advice from the oracle at Delphi, had Daedalus construct a gigantic labyrinth to hold the Minotaur.
        Its location was near Minos' palace in Knossos.[9]

        The Minotaur is commonly represented in Classical art with the body of a man and the head and tail of a bull.
        According to Sophocles' Trachiniai, when the river spirit Achelous seduced Deianira, one of the guises he
        assumed was a man with the head of a bull.

        From Classical times through the Renaissance, the Minotaur appears at the center of many depictions of the
        Labyrinth.[10] Ovid's Latin account of the Minotaur, which did not describe which half was bull and which half
        man, was the most widely available during the Middle Ages, and several later versions show a man's head and
        torso on a bull's body – the reverse of the Classical configuration, reminiscent of a centaur.[11] This
        alternative tradition survived into the Renaissance, and still figures in some modern depictions, such as Steele
        Savage's illustrations for Edith Hamilton's Mythology (1942).</p>
