        In Greek mythology, the Minotaur is a mythical creature portrayed in Classical times with the head and tail of a
        bull and the body of a man or, as described by Roman poet Ovid, a being "part man and part bull". He dwelt at
        the center of the Labyrinth, which was an elaborate maze-like construction designed by the architect Daedalus
        and his son Icarus, on the command of King Minos of Crete. The Minotaur was eventually killed by the Athenian
        hero Theseus.
